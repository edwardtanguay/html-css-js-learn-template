# html-css-js-learn-template

## 2024-03-23 CURRENTLY WORKING ON THIS

This weekend, my plan is to get this framework finished as a "one-stop template for HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites" while learning web development before one starts with JavaScript Frameworks.

## limitations

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript websites in general have serious limitations in terms of user features and developer experience
  - this site is meant to be an academic exercise in order to learn the limits of HTML/CSS/JavaScript sites
- if you want more functionality
  - e.g. if you want to have a backend CRUD API, to use TypeScript, Sass, Tailwind, axios, etc.
- and especially if you are studying to work as a web developer
- then spend your time instead learning **JavaScript frameworks**:
	- [React](https://react.dev) / [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
	- [Vue](https://vuejs.org) / [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)
	- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) / [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)
	- [Angular](https://angular.io)
	- [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com)
	- [Remix](https://remix.run)
	- [Astro](https://astro.build)
	- [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io)

## features

Regardless of the above limitations, if you want to learn the basics of web development, this framework is a good academic exercise showing you how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript together in a realistic environment to create useful, online-hosted websites.

- read-only data sources
    - display rich, structured data from your own JSON files
    - fetch and display data from open APIs that don't have CORS limitations
- component based 
	- learn to program in self-enclosed components that can be reused
	- this is an essential feature of JavaScript frameworks
- modern directory structure
  - with /src directory, similar to JavaScript frameworks
- easy to publish free at Vercel with a reasonable URL 
	- literally publish your site to the web in seconds
- simple page router
  - enables a navigation bar 
  - users can link to, bookmark and resturn to specific pages
- interactive components
  - search forms
- local-storage CRUD
  - one page shows how you can allow a user to create/read/update/delete data which is stored in the browser
